# Objects and Properties in C#

## What is an Object?

In C#, an object is an instance of a class. A class defines the blueprint for creating objects by specifying the properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that the objects will have. Objects are used to model real-world entities, allowing you to encapsulate data and behaviors together.

### Example of Creating an Object

To create an object, you must first define a class and then create an instance of that class.

```csharp
class Car
{
    public string Make { get; set; }
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
}

Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Make = "Toyota";
myCar.Model = "Camry";
myCar.Year = 2022;

Console.WriteLine($"{myCar.Make} {myCar.Model} ({myCar.Year})");
```

### Explanation:

- **Class `Car`**: This class defines the structure of a car with properties like `Make`, `Model`, and `Year`.
- **Object `myCar`**: This is an instance of the `Car` class. It represents a specific car (Toyota Camry, 2022).
- The properties of the object are set using the dot (`.`) notation.

## Properties in C#

Properties in C# are members of a class that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the values of private fields. Properties can be accessed like fields but are actually methods in disguise that control how values are set or retrieved.

### Auto-Implemented Properties

In the example above, the properties `Make`, `Model`, and `Year` are **auto-implemented properties**. They provide a shorthand way to define properties without explicitly defining private fields.

```csharp
public string Make { get; set; }
```

This is a simple way of creating a property with both a `get` (to retrieve the value) and a `set` (to modify the value). C# automatically manages the private field behind the scenes.

### Custom Properties

You can also create custom properties with logic inside the `get` or `set` accessors.

```csharp
private int _year;
public int Year
{
    get { return _year; }
    set
    {
        if (value > 1885) // The first car was built in 1886
            _year = value;
        else
            throw new ArgumentException("Year must be greater than 1885.");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Year` property includes validation logic to ensure that the value is greater than 1885.

## Example of POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) - Car

A **POCO** (Plain Old CLR Object) is a simple class that is free of dependencies on specific frameworks or libraries. POCOs are commonly used in .NET applications, especially with technologies like Entity Framework, where they represent entities from a database.

### Example of a POCO - `Car` Class

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Make { get; set; }
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }

    public string FullDescription
    {
        get { return $"{Year} {Make} {Model}"; }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Class `Car`**: This is a POCO that represents a car with properties like `Id`, `Make`, `Model`, and `Year`.
- **`FullDescription` Property**: This is a read-only property that returns a string with the car's year, make, and model.

### Creating an Object from the POCO

```csharp
Car car = new Car
{
    Id = 1,
    Make = "Toyota",
    Model = "Camry",
    Year = 2022
};

Console.WriteLine($"Car: {car.FullDescription}");
```

This creates an instance of the `Car` class and initializes its properties using an **object initializer**. It outputs the full description of the car.

## Benefits of Using POCOs

1.  **Simplicity**: POCOs are plain, simple classes without any external dependencies.
2.  **Framework Independence**: POCOs can be used across different frameworks and libraries, making them versatile.
3.  **Ease of Testing**: POCOs can easily be tested since they don't contain any specific framework logic.
4.  **Compatibility with ORMs**: POCOs are often used with Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like Entity Framework to represent data models without requiring any specific annotations or inheritance.
