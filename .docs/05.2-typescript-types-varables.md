### **Variables and Primitive Types in TypeScript**

#### **Variables**

Variables in TypeScript are used to store data values. You can declare variables using three keywords: `let`, `const`, and `var`.

- **`let`:** Declares a block-scoped variable, meaning the variable is only accessible within the block in which it is defined. This is the most common way to declare variables in TypeScript.

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
  ```

- **`const`:** Declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned after its initial value is set. It's used for values that should remain constant.

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  const pi: number = 3.14;
  ```

- **`var`:** Declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable. It is less commonly used in TypeScript because `let` and `const` provide better scoping rules.

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  var isDone: boolean = false;
  ```

#### **Primitive Types**

TypeScript has several primitive types that are the most basic data types used in programming. These types are:

1.  **`number`:** Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. TypeScript supports hexadecimal, decimal, binary, and octal literals.

    **Example:**

    ```typescript
    let age: number = 30;
    let price: number = 9.99;
    ```

2.  **`string`:** Represents textual data. String literals can be enclosed in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (```) for template literals.

    **Example:**

    ```typescript
    lt name: string = "Alice";
    let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}!`;
    ```

3.  **`boolean`:** Represents logical values `true` or `false`.

    **Example:**

    ```typescript
    let isActive: boolean = true;
    let isCompleted: boolean = false;
    ```

4.  **`null`:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to signify that a variable currently holds no value.

    **Example:**

    ```typescript
    let nullableValue: null = null;
    ```

5.  **`undefined`:** Represents an uninitialized variable or a variable that hasn't been assigned a value yet.

    **Example:**

    ```typescript
    let undefinedValue: undefined = undefined;
    ```

6.  **`symbol`:** Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as an identifier for object properties. Symbols are primarily used in advanced scenarios, like creating unique keys for object properties.

    **Example:**

    ```typescript
    let uniqueKey: symbol = Symbol("key");
    ```

7.  **`bigint`:** Represents arbitrary-precision integers. This type is used when numbers exceed the safe integer range for the `number` type.

    **Example:**

    ```typescript
    let largeNumber: bigint = 9007199254740991n;
    ```

#### **Type Inference**

TypeScript can automatically infer the type of a variable based on the value you assign to it, so you don't always need to explicitly specify the type.

**Example:**

```typescript
let inferredString = "TypeScript"; // inferred as string
let inferredNumber = 42; // inferred as number
```

#### **Any Type**

The `any` type is a special type that allows you to opt out of type checking for a particular variable. It can be useful in scenarios where you are dealing with dynamic content or migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript.

**Example:**

```typescript
let dynamicValue: any = "Hello";
dynamicValue = 10; // no type error, as it's of ype 'any'
```

#### **Void Type**

The `void` type represents the absence of any type. It is commonly used as the return type for functions that do not return a value.

**Example:**

```typescript
function logMessage(message: string): void {
  console.log(essage);
}
```

#### **Never Type**

The `never` type represents the type of values that never occur. It is typically used to indicate functions that never return or always throw an error.

    **Example:**

    ```typescript
    function error(message: string): never {
      throw new Error(message);
    }
    ```

### **Summary**

- **Variables** in TypeScript can be declared using `let`, `const`, and `var`. `let` and `const` are block-scoped, while `var` is function-scoped.
- **Primitive types** include `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `bigint`.
- **Type inference** allows TypeScript to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its assigned value.
- The **`any` type** allows you to bypass type checking.
- The **`void` type** is used for functions that do not return a value.
- The **`never` type** is used for functions that never return.
