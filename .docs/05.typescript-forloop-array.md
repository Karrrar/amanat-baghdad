### **Arrays in TypeScript**

**Basic Array Declaration:** You can declare an array using two main syntaxes:

1.  Using square brackets `[]`:

    ```typescript
    let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    ```

2.  Using the `Array` generic type:

    ```typescript
    let fruits: Array<string> = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
    ```

**Accessing Array Elements:** Array elements are accessed using their index, with the first element at index `0`.

```typescript
const num = numbers[0];
const fruit = fruits[1];
```

**Modifying Arrays:** You can modify an array by assigning a new value to a specific index.

```typescript
numbers[2] = 10;
```

**Array Methods:** TypeScript arrays come with several built-in methods to manipulate the data:

- `push()`: Adds an element to the end of the array.

  ```typescript
  numbers.push(5); // Adds 5 to the end
  ```

- `pop()`: Removes the last element of the array.

  ```typescript
  let lastNumber = numbers.pop(); // Removes and returns the last element
  ```

- `map()`: Applies a function to each element and returns a new array.
  ```typescript
  let numbers = [1, 2, 10, 4];
  let doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2); // [2, 4, 20, 8]
  ```

### **For Loop in TypeScript**

The `for` loop in TypeScript is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times. It is particularly useful when you need to iterate over a sequence, such as an array, or when you need to run a block of code multiple times.

#### **Basic Syntax of a `for` Loop**

The basic structure of a `for` loop in TypeScript is as follows:

```typescript
for (initialization; condition; increment / decrement) {
  // Code to be executed
}
```

- **Initialization:** This is where you initialize the loop control variable (e.g., `let i = 0`). This statement is executed only once at the beginning of the loop.
- **Condition:** This is the condition that is checked before each iteration of the loop. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the loop continues; if it evaluates to `false`, the loop stops.
- **Increment/Decrement:** This is where you update the loop control variable (e.g., `i++`). It is executed after each iteration of the loop.

#### **Example:**

Here's a simple example that prints numbers from 0 to 4:

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

In this example:

- `let i = 0` initializes the loop control variable `i` to `0`.
- `i < 5` is the condition that checks if `i` is less than `5`. The loop continues as long as this condition is true.
- `i++` increments the value of `i` by `1` after each iteration.

#### **Using a `for` Loop with Arrays**

The `for` loop is often used to iterate over arrays. Here's an example:

```typescript
let fruits: string[] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}
```

**Output:**

```
Apple
Banana
Cherry

```

In this example:

- The loop iterates over the `fruits` array.
- `fruits.length` gives the length of the array, ensuring that the loop runs exactly as many times as there are elements in the array.
- `fruits[i]` accesses each element of the array during each iteration.

#### **Using `for...of` Loop**

TypeScript also provides a `for...of` loop, which is a simpler way to iterate over the elements of an array or any iterable object.

**Example:**

```typescript
let colors: string[] = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];

for (let color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
```

**Output:**

```
Red
Green
Blue

```

In this example:

- The `for...of` loop automatically iterates over each element of the `colors` array, making the code more concise and easier to read.

#### **Using `for...in` Loop**

Another loop that TypeScript supports is the `for...in` loop. It iterates over the keys of an object or array. However, it's more commonly used for objects.

**Example with an Array:**

```typescript
let animals: string[] = ["Dog", "Cat", "Horse"];
for (let index in animals) {
  console.log(index, animals[index]);
}
```

**Output:**

```
0 Dog
1 Cat
2 Horse
```

In this example:

- The `for...in` loop iterates over the indices (or keys) of the `animals` array.

**Example with an Object:**

```typescript
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York" };

for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key, person[key]);
}
```

**Output:**

```

name Alice
age 30
city New York

```

In this example:

- The `for...in` loop iterates over the keys of the `person` object, allowing you to access both the keys and their corresponding values.

#### **Nested `for` Loops**

You can also nest `for` loops within each other. This is useful when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or performing complex iterations.

**Example:**

```typescript
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
    console.log(`i = ${i}, j = ${j}`);
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
i = 1, j = 1
i = 1, j = 2
i = 1, j = 3
i = 2, j = 1
i = 2, j = 2
i = 2, j = 3
i = 3, j = 1
i = 3, j = 2
i = 3, j = 3

```

#### **Breaking and Continuing in a `for` Loop**

- **`break`:** Exits the loop entirely when a certain condition is met.
- **`continue`:** Skips the rest of the loop iteration and continues with the next iteration.

**Example:**

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i is 5
  }
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue; // Skip even numbers
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
3
```

In this example:

- The loop stops completely when `i` reaches `5` because of the `break` statement.
- The loop skips even numbers because of the `continue` statement.
