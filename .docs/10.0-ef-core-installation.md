## **Introduction to Entity Framework (EF)**

EF is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) framework for .NET, which allows developers to interact with databases using .NET objects.

### Installing .NET Core CLI Tools for Entity Framework

To work with Entity Framework Core (EF Core), you need to install the EF Core command-line interface (CLI) tools. These tools allow you to manage migrations, scaffold databases, and perform other common tasks from the terminal or command prompt.

#### 1\. **Pre-requisites**

- You need to have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can verify the installation by running the following command:

  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```

  If the command shows a version number, you're good to go. If not, download and install the .NET SDK from the official [download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

#### 2\. **Install the EF Core Tools**

- You can install the EF Core tools globally or per project.

Installing the tools globally allows you to use the `dotnet ef` commands from anywhere in the terminal.

- Run the following command:

  ```bash
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
  ```

#### 3\. **Verify the Installation**

After installing the tools, you can verify that the installation was successful by running:

```bash
dotnet ef
```

This will show the available commands, confirming that `dotnet-ef` is installed correctly.

```bash
                     _/\__
               ---==/    \\
         ___  ___   |.    \|\

        | _| | _|   \_/ |  //|\\
