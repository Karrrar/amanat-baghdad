# Introduction to C#

## What is C#?

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. It was introduced in 2000 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages, particularly for Windows development, but also for web, cloud, mobile, and game development.

C# is statically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at compile time, and it is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and rich framework support through the .NET ecosystem.

### Key Features of C#:

- **Object-Oriented**: C# is fully object-oriented, supporting classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Type Safety**: C# enforces strong typing, which helps catch errors during compile-time rather than runtime.
- **Rich Library Support**: The .NET framework provides extensive libraries that can be leveraged to build everything from simple desktop apps to complex web services.
- **Garbage Collection**: Memory management is automated in C#, with the garbage collector handling the disposal of unused objects.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: With the introduction of .NET Core, C# can be used to develop applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: C# supports asynchronous programming with async/await, allowing for more efficient execution of tasks like web requests.

## Basic Structure of a C# Program

A typical C# program consists of classes and methods. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```csharp

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of the Code:

- `using System;`: This statement allows the program to use the `System` namespace, which contains basic utilities like input/output operations.
- `namespace HelloWorld`: Defines a namespace to organize code. In larger projects, namespaces help to avoid naming conflicts.
- `class Program`: Declares a class named `Program`. In C#, everything resides in classes, as it is an object-oriented language.
- `static void Main(string[] args)`: This is the entry point of the program. The `Main` method is where the program starts execution. It's marked `static` so that it can be run without creating an instance of the class.
- `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");`: This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Variables and Data Types in C#

C# is a statically-typed language, meaning every variable must be declared with a type. Some common data types in C# are:

- `int`: Represents integers (whole numbers) like `5` or `-100`.
- `double`: Represents floating-point numbers like `3.14` or `-2.718`.
- `bool`: Represents a boolean value, either `true` or `false`.
- `string`: Represents a sequence of characters, such as `"Hello"`.
- `char`: Represents a single character, like `'A'`.
- `decimal`: Used for financial calculations, more precise than `double`.

### Example:

```csharp

int age = 25;
double height = 5.9;
bool isStudent = true;
string name = "John";
char grade = 'A';
```

## Functions in C#

A **function** (also called a **method**) in C# is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help break down complex problems into smaller, reusable code blocks.

### Declaring a Function

A basic function is declared with the following syntax:

```csharp

returnType FunctionName(parameters)
{
    // Code to execute
}
```

### Example of a Function

Here's an example of a simple function that adds two numbers:

```csharp

int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
```

### Calling a Function

To use the `Add` function, we need to call it and provide the required arguments (two integers in this case):

```csharp

int sum = Add(5, 10);
Console.WriteLine(sum);  // Output: 15
```

### Function with No Return Value (`void`)

If a function doesn't return any value, it is declared with the `void` keyword:

```csharp

void PrintMessage(string message)
{
    Console.WriteLine(message);
}
```

### Calling a `void` Function

```csharp

PrintMessage("Hello from C#!");
```

### Functions with Optional Parameters

In C#, you can define optional parameters for a function. If a value is not provided for an optional parameter, the default value is used.

```csharp

void Greet(string name = "Guest")
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name);
}
```

When calling `Greet()`, if no argument is passed, it will use the default value `"Guest"`.

## Control Flow Statements

C# provides common control flow mechanisms such as:

### `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used to make decisions in your program.

```csharp

int number = 10;

if (number > 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is greater than 5.");
}
```

### `for` Loop

A `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

```csharp

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Iteration: " + i);
}
```

### `while` Loop

A `while` loop continues to execute while a certain condition is true.

```csharp

int count = 0;

while (count < 3)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Count: " + count);
    count++;
}
```

## Object-Oriented Programming in C#

C# is a fully object-oriented programming language. Here are key concepts:

### Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public void Introduce()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name} and I am {Age} years old.");
    }
}

Person person = new Person();
person.Name = "Alice";
person.Age = 30;
person.Introduce();
```

### Inheritance

C# supports inheritance, allowing you to define a class that reuses, extends, or modifies the behavior of another class.

```csharp

class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Barking...");
    }
}

Dog dog = new Dog();
dog.Eat();
dog.Bark();

```
