### Objects in TypeScript

**Objects in TypeScript:** Objects in TypeScript are collections of key-value pairs. Each key is a property name, and each value can be of any data type, including other objects, arrays, functions, or primitive types.

**Basic Object Syntax:** You define an object using curly braces `{}` with properties separated by commas.

**Example:**

```ts
let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false,
};
```

In this example, `person` is an object with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `isStudent`.

**Accessing Object Properties:** You can access the properties of an object using dot notation or bracket notation.

**Dot Notation:**

```ts
console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
```

**Modifying Object Properties:** You can modify the properties of an object by assigning a new value to them.

**Example:**

```ts
person.age = 31;
console.log(person.age); // Output: 31
```

**Type Annotations for Objects:** In TypeScript, you can define the structure of an object using type annotations. This ensures that the object adheres to a specific shape.

**Example:**

```ts
let person: { name: string; age: number; isStudent: boolean } = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false,
};
```

Here, the `person` object is explicitly typed to have a `name` property of type `string`, an `age` property of type `number`, and an `isStudent` property of type `boolean`.

**Optional Properties:** You can define optional properties using the `?` symbol. Optional properties are not required in the object.

**Example:**

```ts
let person: { name: string; age: number; isStudent?: boolean } = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};
```

In this example, the `isStudent` property is optional.

### Types in typescript with `type`

TypeScript allows you to define custom types using the `type` keyword. This is useful when you want to reuse the same object structure in multiple places.

**Defining a Type:**

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isStudent?: boolean;
};

let person: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};
```

Here, the `Person` type defines the structure that any object of this type must follow. You can now use `Person` as a type annotation wherever needed.

**Using Types in Functions:** Custom types can also be used to type the parameters and return values of functions.

**Example:**

```ts
function greet(person: Person): string {
  return `Hello, ${person.name}`;
}

console.log(greet(person)); // Output: Hello, Alice
```

### Interfaces

In addition to `type`, TypeScript provides `interface` as another way to define object shapes. Interfaces are similar to types but offer additional features like inheritance.

**Defining an Interface:**

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isStudent?: boolean;
}

let person: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};
```

**Interface Inheritance:** Interfaces can extend other interfaces, allowing you to build more complex types.

**Example:**

```ts
interface Employee extends Person {
  employeeId: number;
}

let employee: Employee = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 25,
  employeeId: 1234,
};
```

Here, the `Employee` interface extends `Person`, adding an `employeeId` property.

### Nullable Types, the `?` Operator, and Optional Chaining (`?.`) in TypeScript

In TypeScript, you can work with values that may be `null` or `undefined` using nullable types, the `?` operator for optional properties, and the optional chaining (`?.`) operator.

**Nullable Types:** You can allow a variable to be `null` or `undefined` by explicitly including these types in its type annotation.

**Example:**

```ts
let name: string | null = null;
let age: number | undefined = undefined;
```

Here, `name` can be either a `string` or `null`, and `age` can be either a `number` or `undefined`.

**The `?` Operator (Optional Properties):** The `?` operator is used to define optional properties in objects. An optional property is not required when creating an object, and it can be `undefined` if not provided.

**Example:**

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age?: number; // age is optional
}

let user1: User = { name: "Alice" }; // age is undefined
let user2: User = { name: "Bob", age: 25 }; // age is 25
```

**Optional Chaining (`?.`):** The optional chaining operator (`?.`) allows you to safely access deeply nested properties of an object without having to explicitly check if each reference in the chain is non-null or non-undefined.

**Example:**

```ts
let user = { name: "Alice", address: { city: "Wonderland" } };

console.log(user?.address?.city); // Output: Wonderland
console.log(user?.contact?.phone); // Output: undefined (no error)
```

In this example, `user?.address?.city` safely accesses the `city` property. If any part of the chain (`user` or `address`) is `null` or `undefined`, the expression short-circuits and returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

**Using the `?` Operator with Function Parameters:** The `?` operator can also be used to mark optional parameters in functions.

**Example:**

```ts
function greet(name: string, greeting?: string): string {
  return greeting ? `${greeting}, ${name}` : `Hello, ${name}`;
}

console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice
console.log(greet("Bob", "Good morning")); // Output: Good morning, Bob`
```

### Array of Objects in TypeScript

In TypeScript, you can create an array that contains objects. This is useful when you need to store multiple records of similar data, like a list of users, products, or any other entities that share a common structure.

**Basic Syntax:** You can define an array of objects by specifying the type of objects that the array will contain.

**Example:**

```ts
let users: { name: string; age: number; isActive: boolean }[] = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 30, isActive: true },
  { name: "Bob", age: 25, isActive: false },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35, isActive: true },
];
```

In this example, `users` is an array of objects where each object represents a user with `name`, `age`, and `isActive` properties.

**Accessing Elements in an Array of Objects:** You can access individual objects in the array using their index, just like with any array.

**Example:**

```ts
console.log(users[0].name); // Output: Alice
console.log(users[1].age); // Output: 25
```

**Modifying Objects in the Array:** You can modify the properties of objects within the array.

**Example:**

```ts
users[1].isActive = true;
console.log(users[1].isActive); // Output: true
```

**Iterating Over an Array of Objects:** You can loop through an array of objects using various methods, such as a `for` loop, `for...of` loop, or the `forEach` method.

**Example with `for` Loop:**

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
  console.log(users[i].name);
}
```

**Example with `for...of` Loop:**

```ts
for (let user of users) {
  console.log(user.name);
}
```

**Example with `forEach`:**

```ts
users.forEach((user) => console.log(user.name));
```

**Using Custom Types with Arrays of Objects:** You can define a custom type or interface to represent the structure of the objects in the array. This makes your code cleaner and easier to manage.

**Example with `type`:**

```ts
type User = { name: string; age: number; isActive: boolean };

let users: User[] = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 30, isActive: true },
  { name: "Bob", age: 25, isActive: false },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35, isActive: true },
];
```

**Example with `interface`:**

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isActive: boolean;
}

let users: User[] = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 30, isActive: true },
  { name: "Bob", age: 25, isActive: false },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35, isActive: true },
];
```

**Filtering and Mapping Over Arrays of Objects:** You can use array methods like `filter` and `map` to manipulate arrays of objects.

**Example: Filtering Active Users:**

```ts
let activeUsers = users.filter((user) => user.isActive);
console.log(activeUsers);
// Output: [{ name: "Alice", age: 30, isActive: true }, { name: "Charlie", age: 35, isActive: true }]
```

**Example: Mapping to Extract Names:**

```ts
let names = users.map((user) => user.name);
console.log(names); // Output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]`
```
