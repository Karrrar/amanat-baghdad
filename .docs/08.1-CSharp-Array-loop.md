# Arrays, `List<T>`, and `foreach` in C#

## What is an Array?

An array is a data structure in C# that holds a fixed number of elements of the same type. Arrays are useful when you want to store multiple values of the same type together in a single variable.

### Declaring and Initializing Arrays

In C# 12, a new syntax called **collection expressions** was introduced, making array initialization simpler and more concise. Here are ways to declare and initialize arrays:

1.  **Declare and initialize with values using collection expressions:**

    ```csharp
    int[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Array initialized with values
    ```

2.  **Declare and initialize separately:**

    ```csharp
    int[] numbers;
    numbers = new int[5]; // Array of 5 integers (initialized to default values)
    ```

### Accessing Array Elements

Array elements are accessed using their index, which starts at 0. So, the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.

```csharp
int[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // 1
int secondNumber = numbers[1]; // 2
```

You can also update array elements by accessing them via their index:

```csharp
numbers[0] = 10; // Update the first element to 10
```

### Length of an Array

The `Length` property gives you the number of elements in an array.

```csharp
int[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
Console.WriteLine(numbers.Length); // Output: 5
```

## `List<T>` in C#

A `List<T>` is a part of the System.Collections.Generic namespace and is more flexible than arrays. Unlike arrays, a `List<T>` can grow and shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.

### Declaring and Initializing a `List<T>`

You can also initialize a `List<T>` using collection expressions in C# 12.

1.  **Declare and initialize with values using collection expressions:**

    ```csharp
    List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // List initialized with values
    ```

2.  **Declare an empty list:**

    ```csharp
    List<int> numbers = new List<int>(); // Empty list
    ```

### Adding and Removing Elements in a `List<T>`

You can dynamically add and remove elements in a `List<T>`:

```csharp
numbers.Add(6); // Adds 6 to the end of the list
numbers.Remove(3); // Removes the first occurrence of 3 from the list
```

### Accessing Elements in a `List<T>`

Just like arrays, `List<T>` elements are accessed by index starting from 0.

```csharp
int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Accessing the first element
```

### Count of a `List<T>`

The `Count` property returns the number of elements in the list:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(numbers.Count); // Output: 5
```

## The `foreach` Loop

The `foreach` loop in C# is used to iterate over elements in arrays or collections (like `List<T>`) without the need to manage the index manually. This is particularly useful when you don't need to modify the collection during iteration.

### Basic Syntax of `foreach```csharp

foreach (var element in collection)
{
// Code to execute for each element
}

````

Here's an example of using a `foreach` loop to iterate over an array:

```csharp
int[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

foreach (int number in numbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
````

And with a `List<T>`:

```csharp
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

foreach (int number in numbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

### How `foreach` Works

In the example above, the `foreach` loop automatically iterates over each element in the array or list, assigning each element to the variable `number`. The loop will keep running until all elements have been processed.

This makes `foreach` a safer and simpler way to loop through arrays or lists, especially when you don't need to modify the elements during iteration.

## Key Differences Between Arrays and `List<T>`

1.  **Size**:

    - **Array**: Fixed size. Once you declare the size of the array, you cannot change it.
    - **List<T>**: Dynamic size. You can add or remove elements as needed.

2.  **Initialization**:

    - **Array**: Must declare a fixed size or initialize with a fixed number of elements.

      ```
      csharp
      Copy code

      `int[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Using collection expressions
      `

      ```

    - **List<T>**: No need to declare size; you can initialize it with values or leave it empty.

      ```
      csharp
      Copy code

      `List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Using collection expressions
      `

      ```

3.  **Adding/Removing Elements**:

    - **Array**: Cannot add or remove elements once the size is set.
    - **List<T>**: You can easily add or remove elements dynamically.

      ```
      csharp
      Copy code

      `numbers.Add(6); // Add 6 to the list
      numbers.Remove(3); // Remove 3 from the list
      `

      ```

4.  **Performance**:

    - **Array**: Faster when working with a fixed number of elements.
    - **List<T>**: Slightly slower than arrays due to dynamic resizing, but more flexible.

## Modifying Elements in `foreach`

In a `foreach` loop, you cannot modify the elements directly, as they are read-only. If you try to change the element, C# will give you a compilation error. If you need to modify the elements, you should use a `for` loop instead.
